# GoBTM
Golang Biterm Topic Model (GoBTM) is adopting BTM C++ code where published by Xiaohuiyan at https://github.com/xiaohuiyan/BTM

I try to make BTM code in Go and simplify the codes, I hope this code can help developer/researcher who interest on Topic Model especially LDA, BTM, and its variances. You can find brief explanation paper by "Xiaohui Yan, Jiafeng Guo, Yanyan Lan, Xueqi Cheng. A Biterm Topic Model For Short Text. WWW2013."
